:::::::::::::::In simple terms, Iterable and Iterator are both interfaces provided in Java's Collection Framework.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::Iterable::
A class has to implement the Iterable interface if it wants to have a for-each loop to iterate over its collection. 
However, the for-each loop can only be used to cycle through the collection in the forward direction and 
you won't be able to modify the elements in this collection. But, if all you want is to read the elements data, 
then it's very simple and thanks to Java lambda expression it's often one liner. For example:

iterableElements.forEach (x -> System.out.println(x) );
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Iterator:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This interface enables you to iterate over a collection, obtaining and removing its elements. 
Each of the collection classes provides a iterator() method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. 
The advantage of this interface over iterable is that with this interface you can add, modify or remove elements in a collection. 
But,accessing elements needs a little more code than iterable.
:::::::::For example::::::::::
for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
  Element e = i.next();
  System.out.println(e);
}
