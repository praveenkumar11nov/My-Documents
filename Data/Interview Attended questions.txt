1.	What is immutable class? How to create immutable class? Why we use immutable class ?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Immutable class means that once an object is created, we cannot change its content. In Java, all the wrapper classes
(like String, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable. We can create our own immutable class as well. 
Using immutable Class we can achieve Thread Safe because the state cannot be changed no synchronization is required.
Following are Requirements to make Class Immutable :
i.	Class must be declared as final (so that child classes can’t be created).
ii.	Data members in Class must be declared as final (so that we can’t change the value of it after object creation ) and private.
iii.	A parameterized constructor
iv.	Getter methods for all the variables in it.
v.	No setters (to not have a option to change the value of instance variables)

 // An immutable class
public final class Student
{
        final String name;
        final int regNo;
        public Student(String name, int regNo)
       {
             this.name = name;
             this.regNo = regNo;
       }
       public String getName()
      {
        return name;
    }
    public int getRegNo()
    {
        return regNo;
    }
}
class Test
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Student s = new Student("ABC", 101);
        System.out.println(s.name);
        System.out.println(s.regNo);
 
        // Uncommenting below line causes error
        // s.regNo = 102;
    }
}
o/p : ABC
        101

2.	What is abstract class ? when abstract class constructor gets executed and when to use abstract class?
A class declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class. An abstract class can have a. only concrete methods b. only abstract methods
c. both concrete and abstract methods. We cannot create an instance of abstract class , hence we cannot refer or access the instance members of abstract class. 
If abstract class has static members then we can access it through class name. If a class is declared as abstract it is not mandatory to have abstract methods.
If any class is having abstract methods then the class must be mandatorily declared as abstract.
If a java class inherits the abstract behaviors from abstract class then subclass must define the definition for inherited abstract methods otherwise class
should be declared  as abstract.
The abstract method of a abstract class can be overrided in any level of subclasses. If subclasses doesn’t specify the body for abstract methods then the class
must be made as abstract.
 
abstract class Sample1
{
	int a,b;
     Sample1(int x,int y)
     {
    	 a=x;
    	 b=y;
    	 System.out.println("Sample1 Constructor a = "+a+" , b = "+b);
     }
}
class Example extends Sample1{
	
	Example()
	{
		super(10,6);
		System.out.println("Example");
	}
}

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Example example = new Example();	
		
	}

}
o/p : Sample1 Constructor a = 10 , b = 6
